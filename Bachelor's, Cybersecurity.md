# 🎓 Is a Cybersecurity Degree Worth It?

## TL;DR

A cybersecurity degree can help with certain jobs, but it won’t teach you the hands-on skills you actually need to succeed.  
If you’re starting from zero, begin with **labs, practical learning, and real experimentation**.  
If you already have employer funding or college credits, the **SANS Bachelor’s Program** is one of the few that blend theory with applied training.

## 🎯 My Experience Starting With a Cybersecurity Degree

When I decided to transition from the military into cybersecurity, I thought the best first step was to earn a degree. It’s what recruiters, schools, and job postings all seemed to recommend. So I enrolled in a **Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity** program.

At the time, a few of my fellow weapons instructors and I all decided to take the same path. There were four of us in total who jumped into the same degree program, thinking it would set us up for a smooth transition into the field. Three of us have already finished, and two more are close to graduating.

Unfortunately, only two of us have stayed relevant in the cybersecurity field. The program just didn’t capture what makes this work interesting. It was heavily structured and informative, but almost entirely theoretical. We were learning about frameworks, policies, and terminology instead of actually securing or testing systems.

Looking back, I’m glad I finished my degree, but only because the military covered the cost. For most people, the time and expense aren’t justified by the limited technical experience it provides.

## 🧠 What College Actually Taught Me

I expected to learn about hacking, defending networks, and responding to real attacks. Instead, I learned about frameworks, compliance, and general IT fundamentals. These are important topics, but they don’t teach you how to think like a security professional or solve real problems.

The real growth started when I began **experimenting on my own**.  
I built virtual environments, broke things on purpose, and learned how to fix them. That hands-on work gave me the experience that college never could.

## 🧰 Hands-On Learning That Builds Real Skills

If I could start over, I’d treat the degree as a long-term goal and focus first on learning by doing.  
Here are the methods and platforms that helped me the most:

### 💻 1. Build a Home Lab
Use **VMware Workstation** or **VirtualBox** to create your own practice environment.  
Set up multiple virtual machines, install different operating systems, and simulate real networks.  
Experiment with vulnerabilities, permissions, and configurations until you understand how things work together.

### 🧩 2. Learn Through Practice Platforms
Sites like **Hack The Box**, **TryHackMe**, and **PortSwigger Web Security Academy** provide safe, guided ways to apply your skills.  
They teach you how to analyze systems, exploit weaknesses, and understand both the attacker and defender perspectives.

### 🌐 3. Join the Community
Networking matters more than people realize.  
If you’re introverted, start online by joining **Discord groups**, **Reddit communities**, or **cybersecurity servers** where people share tips and labs.  
If you can, attend **BSides conferences** or local security meetups.  
Being around others in the field accelerates your learning more than studying alone ever could.

## 📜 Where a Degree Actually Helps

A degree can still be valuable. It checks a box for many employers, especially in government or defense roles, and demonstrates commitment to structured learning.  
But it shouldn’t be the first thing you pursue. Build your foundation with real skills first. Then, use a degree to strengthen your credentials later.

## 🔍 Final Thoughts: Is a Cybersecurity Degree Worth It?

Cybersecurity is a craft that requires constant experimentation. You won’t master it by writing papers or listening to lectures. You learn by doing, breaking, and rebuilding until it makes sense.

If you’re new to the field, flip the traditional order:
1. Get hands-on with labs and virtual environments.  
2. Practice on learning platforms until you’re comfortable troubleshooting and attacking real systems.  
3. Then pursue a degree once you understand what area of cybersecurity you want to specialize in.

If you want both structure and real training, the **SANS Bachelor’s Program** is worth considering. It combines theory with the type of hands-on learning that truly builds skill.
